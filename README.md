**Still a huge WIP but hi! I mostly go by Skittles, TwoTime, Hacklord, Ryne or Medkit! I also like to be called after other characters i present myself with. Please don't call me Foggy / Fog unless we're close or you knew me while i was using that name ; i changed names due to bad experiences. I do not mind being called Phog/Phoggy though because it's a funi inside joke + a OC i really like.**

**Bold - Important/hyperfixated/comfort/etc depending on what is bolded**

> **BYI**

I have severe bipolar disorder and can be VERY sensitive. I can also get pissed really easily so just please always IWVEC unless close friend. Also please be aware that i CAN randomly spite you even if we never met and be unreasonably rude. Sorry. 

I'm not comfortable with the Dandys World fandom at all, so please either DNIUID or DNIUF. 

Im all free for C+H! Feel free to C+H *as long* as i don't have DNI in my name or im already in a cuddle pile of sorts. 

I have a odd typing quirk where i replace F with PH, say words funny or etc. If you can't understand me sorry! Also do NOT mock me for any odd way i say things, it's a quirk i got used to.

Please don't vent without asking or try and comfort me when i rant out of anger! Unfortunately due to brain damage + mental issues i cannot express much of how i genuinely feel, so i may seem blunt when responding to sudden vents. I don't really like being comforted or talking about my issues either. 

Also please don't have ship discourses or wars around me. I think this is common sense though. 

**I can be AFK/semiAFK , zoned out or playing Roblox/offtab at any given moment even if not stated in name so I'm always under slow resp! If i don't respond I'm likely zoned out, AFK or offtab.**

*Also i hate having to state this but it has happened multiple times so . . . Please do not use me as free bait during Free Builds when someone is Griefing. I rarely build more than a table and a cookie (signature item) due to Griefers + because im usually AFK at either these or Hangouts. So no I'm not Griefing and no my quietness doesn't give you the right to accuse me.*

> **DNI**

i don't really haaaave a DNI besides likee. . . Specific things :T


**DW shippers.** - I don't like you. ***Especially*** Fruitcake and Moonflower shippers.

**Generally blunt/dry people.** - Idkkk im just very sensitive so it's likely we won't work out. This includes people who are rude for no reason. 

**Shared IRLS.** - Mostly for my own comfort :T, i only IRL Broker, TwoTime, Hacklord, Ryne and Skittles. If we're friends then idm sharing IRLs since I'm technically comfortable with you!

**Overly sexual people.** - I find sexual jokes funny, yes, but not when overdone. This concludes to my other friends ; so please just don't be too sexual towards us especially if you're a stranger. 

**Toxichero, Subkit and AdminVirus haters.** - idm if you dislike the ships in question but if you absolutely *despise* them and are generally ready to harass someone over them assuming it's toxic/etc please stay 50 Shedletskys away. Both for your and my safety, please.

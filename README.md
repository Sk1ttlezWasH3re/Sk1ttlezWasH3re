<i>Do note i <b>can</b> and will say things i don't actually mean . Not on purpose no , but it's more than possible , not to mention we take most things to heart due to bpd so just please be careful with us , you cry and we'll cry . We may also get attached pretty easily .</i>

<b>Wanna say this due to most recent drama — If you are ready to harass me about <i>ANYTHING</i> i have previously said about systems or stood by ; please kindly stay away and leave me the fuck alone for once . Stop calling me ableist over discomfort i cannot control . People like you are the main reason i can't change to be a better person . Thank You .</b>

We play Forsaken a LOT when we afk and , we'd prefer to not be bothered so please DNI in that case unless a close friend . Do keep note if we are with a friend already we'd rather prefer not to be interacted w/ unless its compliments , to point out we share a fandom — Or for the good sake of roleplay if we are in one .</p>

> <sup> Hello! We mainly go by Skittles and Rust, although we accept names such as Noli, TwoTime, Jx1dx1 and sometimes Abaddon and any other heavy kin/IRL char. We also accept just "ok". . . It's a funny one. WE HAVE BPD AND ALEXITHYMIA. We in most cases can't recognize what you express unless tonetags are used. We also split often & cannot function without you 4 an extended period of time if we manage to attach(which'll be very rare),, we have severe attachment issues of many kinds. Sorry about that. </sup>

<sup>Reminder some ships we like are rather controversial/publicly deemed ' invalid ' and only make sense/are backed up by specific AUs (for example Sean x Jx1dx1 , Soviet Union x United States) **DO NOT ATTACK US OVER THIS PLEASE AND THANK YOU , WE HAVE OUR REASONS.** — simply DNI if you are uncomfortable with this. Reminder we do not proship and this will NEVER be a excuse 4 that.</sup>
